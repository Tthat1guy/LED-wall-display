# LED-wall-display
this is the code for the LED wall display I created out of generic addressable LEDs, with a Arduino Nano as a controller

if you wish to make this project instructions are avaible for free at   https://www.instructables.com/editor/EVYUHKQMCKVL9K2 (currently unpublished)

the LED display is fully addressable allowing you to create any design you want.
